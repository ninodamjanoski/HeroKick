# Answers
1. I have started working on the coding task last Monday evening on 01.10.2019. I was spending no more than 2 hours per day during the week,
 but there were a days, like around 3 days when I wasnt working on the task at all.
2. I have added effort and made the solution using androids latest paging library, to have paging implemented since I was fetching a list of items,
 and the endpoint supports paging. I would have added if I have spend more time also, more structured and organized styles, in order to support styling
 scalability. What I wanted to add also, if I had more time, is besides unit tests, to write Instrumented tests for the Ui flow,
 and scenarios, I needed 2-3 more hours, but since it wasnt required by the task, I skiped this.
